# LightClientServices

This is a experimental library to run substrate node on Android as a background Service.

As Android API 29+ [removes execute permission for app home directory](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/behavior-changes-10#execute-permission), it is not impossible to run the binary file in [app-specific external storage](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/app-specific).

### To Test

1. Press "Download" button to download the compiled binary file (currently only has the link for aarch64-linux-android)
2. Press "Start Service Button"
